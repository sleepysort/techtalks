/**
 * This is the socket object that we will use to communicate with the server.
 * there are two methods on this object that we will be concerned with:
 *
 *     io.on(EVENT_TYPE, CALLBACK)
 *         This attaches a CALLBACK for the given EVENT_TYPE. Whenever you receive a message
 *         from the server of a given EVENT_TYPE, your CALLBACK will be called with the
 *         corresponding data interface.
 *         The EVENT_TYPEs you can expect *from* the server are:
 *             - ChatEventType.JoinAccepted      When a new user joins the server.
 *             - ChatEventType.UserJoined        When a new user joins the server.
 *             - ChatEventType.UserExited        When a user leaves the server.
 *             - ChatEventType.MessageReceived   When a new message is received.
 *             - ChatEventType.Echo              What the server will reply with when you emit an 'Echo'.
 *
 *     io.once(EVENT_TYPE, CALLBACK)
 *         Same as io.on(), but will only call the CALLBACK once, and detach from the event afterwards.
 *
 *     io.emit(EVENT_TYPE, DATA)
 *         This sends DATA to the server with the given EVENT_TYPE. The server will process
 *         the DATA appropriately, assuming that it is the correct data type.
 *         the EVENT_TYPEs you can send *to* the server are:
 *             - ChatEventType.JoinRequest       When you wish to join the server.
 *             - ChatEventType.MessageSent       When you want to send a chat message to the server.
 *             - ChatEventType.Echo              When you want to test the connection; server will reply with an echo.
 *
 * Go to https://socket.io/docs/client-api/ for more details.

/**
 * This is the readline interface object that we will use to read from the console's standard in.
 * The readline interface also uses an event driven pattern. The methods we might want to use include:
 *
 *     rl.on(EVENT_TYPE, CALLBACK)
 *         This attaches a CALLBACK for the given EVENT_TYPE.
 *         The only event you should be concerned with for the exercise is "line", which will be
 *         when a line from stdin is entered. The CALLBACK will be called with the line string.
 *
 *     rl.question(PROMPT, CALLBACK)
 *         Prints the given PROMPT string to the console and waits for a response from stdin. Calls the
 *         CALLBACK with the user's response via stdin.
 *
 * Go to https://nodejs.org/api/readline.html#readline_class_interface for more details.
